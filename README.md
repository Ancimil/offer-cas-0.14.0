# Offer

This repository contains Offer Service (Offer Api) prototype implemented according to architectural requirements (onion architecture).
Offer Service DAL is implemented using Repository pattern and Entity Framework. 

# Architecture

This service is developed as an implementation example of CQRS and DDD recommended architecture for microservices.

## Project structure

**Offer**

- API implementation of Offer

**Offer.Infrastructure**

- Database configuration, infrastructure configuration setup

**Offer.Domain**

- Domain models

# Features

## Price Calculation

Price calculationis used to resolve DMN rules and create product defined price variations. Variable prices are interest rates and fees' percentage.

### Pricing rule currency

Every price variation (fees and interest rates) has property ```pricing-rule-currency``` which represents currency of ```amountInRuleCurrency``` property in DMN tables. This is used for standardizing DMN amount values regardless of selected currency on arrangement request.

Example:
In DMN table field ```amount``` is available, and arrangement request has currency as *EUR* available in DMN table as ```currency``` field.
Bank wants to define price variation on regular interest of **-0.2%** if loan is greater than **1.000.000.00 RSD**.
We have ```amount``` in **EUR**, but condition in **RSD**. Here ```amountInRuleCurrency``` steps in and we can use it in rules instead of ```amount```.

### DMN rules

Every DMN table must have output fields named ```variationGroup```, ```variationDescription``` and ```percentage``` in order price calculation to work.
Input fields available for use in rules are as follows:

- channel
- customerSegment
- currency
- amount
- term
- collateralModel
- riskScore
- productBundling
- amountInRuleCurrency

These DMN tables are stored in ```product/price-variations``` configuration parent key.

Default price variation parameters are stored on configuration as key ```price-calculation/defaults```.
Example of default parameters:

```json
{
    "collateral-model": "co-debtor",
    "product-bundling": "0001",
    "risk-score": 1,
    "customer-segment": "professional"
}
```

# API 

This API is implemented according to Offer V2 specification. Currently this specification is not finished yet.

## Future work

Some parts of this API will be in the seperate NuGet package for global usage in other microservices. 

# Docker 

Inside this repository there is [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) specifiying all environment variables for Offer Container. In this file you may also find samples for running Offer as Container.

# Development

To develop on Offer API you need to run MSSQLServer on localhost with next command on Docker:

```docker run --name mssql -eACCEPT_EULA=Y -eSA_PASSWORD=Sifra123# -eMSSQL_PID=Express -p1433:1433 -d microsoft/mssql-server-linux:2017-latest```

and also you need to run digitalo-broker:

```docker run --name broker -eENABLE_JMX=true -eJMX_PORT=1199 -eJMX_RMI_PORT=1198 -eARTEMIS_USERNAME=admin -eARTEMIS_PASSWORD=admin -eTOPICS=offer,bpm,product,party,notifications,errors -p61613:61613 -p5672:5672 -p61616:61616 -p8161:8161 -p61623:61623 -d registry.asseco.rs/asseco/digitalo-broker``` 

After running these two containers you can start the Offer API and start development.
